this is a report describing the results obtained from jacoco analysis.

Note: I'll be ignoring the main class, as it appears to only be a setup for an example.

Before:
    coverage: 80%
    tqs.euromillions: 
        points to improve:
            test format()
            test countDips() for correct output
            test if changing a value in the dip changes the hash code
            test if equals can detect dip difference (even if the changes are minor)
            improve testConstructorFromBadArrays to cover branches where the arrays are too big
    tqs.sets:
        complete disabled tests
        test if returns error from exceeding bounds
        test difference between sets
        complete and test intersect

After:
    instruction coverage: 88%
    branch coverage: 85%
    I do not improve anymore, as the missed ones are mainly from the main "demo" function and because it sometimes fails to identify tested branches on equals
