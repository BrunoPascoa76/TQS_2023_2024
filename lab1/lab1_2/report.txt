this is a report describing the results obtained from jacoco analysis.

Note: I'll be ignoring the main class, as it appears to only be a setup for an example.

Before:
    tqs.euromillions: 
        coverage: 80%
        points to improve:
            test format()
            test countDips() for correct output
            test if changing a value in the dip changes the hash code
            test if equals can detect dip difference (even if the changes are minor)
            improve testConstructorFromBadArrays to cover branches where the arrays are too big
    tqs.sets:
        complete disabled tests
        test if creating fromArray is the same as creating then adding
        test if returns error from exceeding bounds
        test if slightly different arrays produce different hashes
        test difference between sets
        test initial size and size after operations (add,...)
